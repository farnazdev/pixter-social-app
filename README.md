# Pixter – Social Media Android App

## Getting Started

Pixter is a fully functional Android-based social media platform, built to connect users through messaging, content sharing, and interactive features like following, liking, and commenting.
It combines a native mobile client with a real-time backend to deliver a seamless social experience.

Note: This is my associate's thesis project.

##  How It Works

1. Users sign up or log in with secure credentials
2. After authentication, users can:
3. Upload and share image posts
4. Start private chats with other users
5. Like or comment on posts from their feed
6. Follow or unfollow other users
7. The app communicates with a backend server via HTTP API (written in PHP)
8. All user data, images, and chat logs are stored and served dynamically from the backend

## Logs

While this app doesn’t maintain traditional logs, the backend handles and stores:

- 📅 User login/logout sessions
- 💬 Message history for chats
- 🖼️ Image upload metadata
- 🔁 API request/response logs for debugging (server-side)

## Requirements

- Frontend: Android Studio (Java)
- Backend: PHP server with API endpoints for auth, post, and chat
- Database: MySQL
- Image Handling: Glide library for smooth media loading
- API Communication: RESTful API calls over HTTP

---

## Testing

- Create a new account or use test credentials
- Upload an image post and verify it appears on the feed
- Initiate a private chat between two users
- Like/comment on posts and validate interactions
- Test follow/unfollow and view post filtering
- Simulate network delays and confirm app handles API errors gracefully
